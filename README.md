**Purpose:** To analyze occurances of theme words in the plays King Lear, As You Like It, and Antony & Cleopatra. Several of the methods print out tables which are meant to be copy and pasted into an Excel sheet and then graphed in a network using Google's Fusion Tables.
                
### Fusion tables: ###
- [King Lear Character Network](https://www.google.com/fusiontables/DataSource?docid=1G38cSLcV41NIwwZ4CtHK9_9Bz0oSHtpdxE9AEIlw)
- [Proportional Themes](https://www.google.com/fusiontables/DataSource?docid=1sLQvztOwtQM36bGTx_dk-auzyF3Ngave-tmKY2RI)
**TODO:**
- Proportional themes with updated words
- Character charts for Antony & Cleopatra and As You Like It
